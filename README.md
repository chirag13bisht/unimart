# Unimart

The student marketplace to buy and sell second hand without postage or packaging.

## The problem
Existing online marketplaces for students require postage and packaging, hindering the easy buying and selling of second-hand items. At UniMart, we understand the financial challenges that students face and the need for sustainable practices. That's why we've built a community-driven platform where you can easily sell your used items, and even rent them out to fellow students. Join our vibrant community today and start making money while helping to reduce waste on campus!
